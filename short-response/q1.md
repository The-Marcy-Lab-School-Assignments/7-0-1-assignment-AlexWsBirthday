# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer
The two arguments that useEffect accepts are a callback function (which usually holds an asyncronous fetch function), and an optional dependency array (an array of values that react watches for changes, and executes the callback function according to when any of the values change).
