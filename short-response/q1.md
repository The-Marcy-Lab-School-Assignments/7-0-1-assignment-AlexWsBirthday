# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer
The two arguments that useEffect accepts are a callback function (which usually holds an asyncronous fetch function), and an optional dependency array (an array of values that react watches for changes, and executes the callback function according to when any of the values change).

You could clarify that the callback function is executed after the render and can optionally return a cleanup function. Also, mentioning that the dependency array determines when the effect runs—whether on every render or only when specified values change—would provide additional clarity.
